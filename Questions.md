1. Write a C++ program to implement a simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division using function overloading.

2. Create a class representing a bank account with methods to deposit, withdraw, and check the
balance. Implement this using encapsulation principles.

3. Design a base class `Shape` with a virtual function `area()`. Derive classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` from it, each implementing the `area()` method. Demonstrate polymorphism by calculating the area of different shapes using base class pointers.

4. Implement a C++ program that uses templates to create a function that swaps two values of any
data type.

5. Write a program that defines an abstract class `Animal` with a pure virtual function `makeSound()`. Create derived classes `Cat` and `Dog`, each providing their own implementation of
`makeSound()`.

6. Create a class hierarchy for vehicles with a base class `Vehicle` and derived classes `Car` and
`Truck`. Implement methods to display the type of vehicle and its maximum speed.

7. Write a C++ program that demonstrates the use of friend functions by creating two classes: `A`
and `B`. Class `B` should have a friend function that can access private members of class `A`.

8. Implement operator overloading for the `&lt;&lt;` operator to print the details of a custom class
representing a book (title, author, price).

9. Write a program that reads an array of integers from the user and uses dynamic memory
allocation to store them. Implement functions to find the maximum and minimum values in the
array.

10. Create a class named `Matrix` that supports addition and multiplication of matrices using
operator overloading.

11. Design an interface (abstract class) named `Payment` with methods for processing payments.
Implement two derived classes: `CreditCardPayment` and `PayPalPayment`, each providing their
own implementation for processing payments.

12. Write a C++ program that demonstrates multiple inheritance by creating two base classes,
`Person` and `Employee`, and deriving a class `Manager` from both.

13. Implement a stack data structure using an array in C++. Include methods for push, pop, and
display operations.

14. Create a program that simulates a library system where users can borrow and return books. Use
classes to represent books and users, implementing appropriate member functions.

15. Write a C++ program that reads student records (name, ID, grades) from the user and stores
them in a vector. Implement sorting functionality based on grades.

16. Design a simple game where the player can choose between different characters (e.g., Warrior,
Mage) using inheritance and polymorphism to define character behavior.

17. Create an exception handling mechanism in C++ to handle division by zero errors in your
calculator program.

18. Write a program that implements the Singleton design pattern to ensure only one instance of a
configuration manager exists throughout the application.

19. Develop a console-based address book application where users can add, delete, search, and
display contacts using classes and file handling for data persistence.

20. Create a C++ program that implements binary search on an array using recursion.
